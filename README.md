# useR!2017 tutorial: Data Carpentry -- Open and Reproducible Science with R

Three hour mini-lesson based on Reproducible Science Curriculum material. This
presentation is a modification of
a [2-hour lesson](http://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/cbb-retreat/)
put together by Hilmar Lapp presented at the CBB Retreat in Wrightsville Beach
on Sep 26, 2015.
